>When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When i am not on my local computer or when i am at office.

>Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Other people may be working on my project that i have uploaded on Github and i dont want it to mix with my work.

>Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a clone of the repository on GitHub. Clone is a copy of a repository on your local machine. Branch is another label given to a commit to make experimental changes that is somewhat different from the main working code. Fork is used when i want to work on somebody else's project without affecting their work. Clone is a copy of a GitHub repository on your local machine. Branch is a way to make explorations.
