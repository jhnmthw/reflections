When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When i am not on my local computer or when i am at office.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Other people may be working on my project that i have uploaded on Github and i dont want it to mix with my work.
