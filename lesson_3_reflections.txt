>When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When i am not on my local computer or when i am at office.

>Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Other people may be working on my project that i have uploaded on Github and i dont want it to mix with my work.

>Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a clone of the repository on GitHub. Clone is a copy of a repository on your local machine. Branch is another label given to a commit to make experimental changes that is somewhat different from the main working code. Fork is used when i want to work on somebody else's project without affecting their work. Clone is a copy of a GitHub repository on your local machine. Branch is a way to make explorations. 

>What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So that we may be aware of the master of origin even though we are offline.

>How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without github i would have to collaborate with my collegues by calling them. It would be more harder if i didnt use github.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Making seperate changes in a seoarate branch ensure that i always have a working code with me all the time. I do not have to deal with the fear that i have broken everything. I can experiment peacefully on my prohect. We can make changes on the master branch if our project is small.
